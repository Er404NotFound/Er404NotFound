<li>Hello!, My name is <b><u>B</u></b> and I'm a 30 something learning to "code" for fun in my spare time. </li>
<li>All help and suggestions welcomed on anything I "create" here. I'm sure it's mostly super basic stuff, like <i>this profile</i> </li>
<li>Always looking for anything helpful in access control or physical security in general. I work in the safety and security field, and would like to be able to advance into the tech side of things rather than the physical. </li>
