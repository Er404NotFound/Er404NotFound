Hello!, My name is B and I'm a 30 something learning to "code" for fun in my spare time. 
All help and suggestions welcomed on anything I "create" here. I'm sure it's mostly super basic stuff, like <i>this</i> profile
Always looking for anything helpful in access control or physical security in general. I work in the safety and security field, and would like to be able to advance into the tech side of things rather than the physical.
